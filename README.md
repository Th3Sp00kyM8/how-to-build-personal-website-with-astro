# how-to-build-personal-website-with-astro

This project walks you through how to create a modern personal website. The same way developers and cybersecurity professionals showcase their work online.
You’ll learn how to:

1. Set up an Astro project (static site generator).

2. Add Tailwind CSS for fast, modern styling.

3. Customize your content and structure.

4. Deploy your site for free using Vercel or GitHub Pages.

No heavy coding required. Just follow along, edit a few files, and you’ll have your own personal site running in less than an hour.


## Why Astro

Astro is ideal for personal and portfolio sites:

- Blazing fast (static-site optimized)
- Beginner-friendly
- Works with React, Svelte, or plain HTML
- Easy to deploy anywhere

## What You’ll Need

Before starting, make sure you have these three things installed — all are free and take just a few minutes:

1. Node.js – The engine that runs Astro
- Download Node.js (LTS version)

2. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Your code editor
- Download VS Code
- You’ll use this to open and edit your site’s files.

Once everything’s installed:

Create a new folder anywhere on your computer (e.g. my-website).

Open it in VS Code.

You’ll use the terminal inside VS Code to run commands — don’t worry, they’re simple and I’ll explain what each one does.

### Why These Tools

These tools are what most modern developers use. Node.js powers Astro, VS Code makes editing clean and visual, and GitHub lets you version, share, and deploy your work publicly — just like any real-world project.


Step 1: Open VS Code and Start a Terminal

1. Open the folder you created earlier (e.g., my-website).
- Open the folder you created earlier (e.g., my-website).
- Inside VS Code, go to the top menu and click: View → Terminal


Step 2: Create a New Astro Project

1. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
- npm create astro@latest

2. Then follow the prompts:

- Project name: Press Enter to use the default (my-website).
- Template: Choose “Minimal” — this gives you a clean starting point.
- Install dependencies: Type Yes when asked.

Once finished, Astro will create your project folder and install everything it needs.


Step 3: Run Your Project

1. Start the local server:
- npm run dev

2. You’ll see something like:
- Local: http://localhost:4321/
- Open that link in your browser — congratulations, you’re running your first Astro site locally!


Step 4: Make Your First Edit

1. Try changing the text inside index.astro to something personal:
- Your Name

2. Then save the file and refresh your browser — your changes will appear instantly.
